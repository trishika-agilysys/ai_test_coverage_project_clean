# Optimized Training Configuration Summary

## Data Analysis Results
- **Dataset**: `augmented_postman_tests_for_training.shortened.jsonl`
- **Samples**: 149 training samples
- **Input length**: ~120-200 characters (API endpoint descriptions)
- **Output length**: ~400-800 characters (3 `pm.test` blocks + setup code)
- **Domain**: Payment processing API testing (PayAgent)

## Optimized Model Configuration

### Model Architecture
- **Base Model**: `Salesforce/codet5-base`
- **Input Length**: 512 tokens (reduced from 768)
- **Output Length**: 1024 tokens (reduced from 2048)
- **Device**: Auto-detect CUDA/CPU

### Training Hyperparameters
- **Learning Rate**: 5e-5 (increased from 3e-5 for faster convergence)
- **Batch Size**: 4 (reduced from 8 for better gradient updates)
- **Effective Batch Size**: 16 (4 × 4 gradient accumulation steps)
- **Epochs**: 15 (increased from 10 for small dataset)
- **Warmup Steps**: 100 (increased from 50 for small dataset)
- **Weight Decay**: 0.01 (increased from 0.001 for regularization)
- **Early Stopping Patience**: 5 (increased from 3)

### Evaluation Settings
- **Eval Steps**: 25 (evaluate every 25 steps)
- **Save Steps**: 50 (save checkpoints every 50 steps)
- **Logging Steps**: 10 (log every 10 steps)

## Expected Training Behavior

### Phase 1: Foundation Training (Epochs 1-5)
- Model learns basic Postman test structure
- Focus on pattern recognition
- Expected loss: 2.0 → 1.0

### Phase 2: Refinement Training (Epochs 6-10)
- Model learns API-specific patterns
- Focus on domain-specific improvements
- Expected loss: 1.0 → 0.5

### Phase 3: Fine-tuning (Epochs 11-15)
- Model focuses on edge cases and error scenarios
- Early stopping if no improvement
- Expected loss: 0.5 → 0.3

## Success Metrics
- **Training Loss**: < 0.5 by epoch 10
- **Validation Loss**: < 0.7 by epoch 10
- **Exact Match Rate**: > 60% on validation set
- **Syntax Validity**: > 90% of generated tests

## Expected Training Time
- **GPU**: ~30-45 minutes for 15 epochs
- **CPU**: ~2-3 hours for 15 epochs
- **Memory Usage**: ~4-6 GB VRAM

## Output
- **Model Directory**: `models/codet5_postman_tests_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS/`
- **Checkpoints**: Saved every 50 steps
- **Best Model**: Automatically saved based on validation loss

## Data Quality Filters
The training data has been filtered to include only:
- Outputs with ≥ 100 characters
- No TODO comments
- ≥ 3 `pm.test` blocks per sample
- Complete outputs (ending with proper closing brace)

## Next Steps
1. Run training: `python train.py`
2. Monitor training progress in logs
3. Evaluate sample generations during training
4. Test final model on new API endpoints
